-- In MySQL, database creation is a bit more manual, firstly I will begin by setting up a schema, or table structure, for the data I intend to import

-- Create database from scratch, and set my environment to this database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS vgames;

USE vgames;

-- Create a schema for the table by specifying the column name and type
CREATE TABLE games
(
	img VARCHAR(255),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    console VARCHAR(255),
    genre VARCHAR(255),
    publisher VARCHAR(255),
    critic_score DOUBLE,
    total_sales DOUBLE,
    na_sales DOUBLE,
    jp_sales DOUBLE,
    pal_sales DOUBLE,
    other_sales DOUBLE,
    release_date DATE
);

-- Null values in the numerical columns are causing errors as they are interpreted as empty strings by the interpreter, and raise a completely unrelated error involving data truncation.
-- After being sent on a wild goose chase and trying to conceptualize why this error would come up in the interpreter, I managed to pinpoint the actual error and rectify a solution.
-- Thanks MySQL
-- I was able to convert the empty strings that got flagged to actual nulls using the built in NULLIF() function, but its a lot of code
